image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. The private subnets are not used by this Quick Start, but you can use them for future deployments.*
* In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* (Optional) A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* A single instance of AWS Cloud9.

* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and policy that will be associated with your AWS Cloud9 instance.
* AWS Lambda functions that run one-time https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html[custom resources], at the time of stack creation, to perform the following operations:

* Resizing the default Amazon EBS volume size for your AWS Cloud9 instance based on the input that you provide at stack launch.
* Associating the instance profile.
* Running a configurable bootstrap script against AWS Systems Manager Run Command.
